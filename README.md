# Food Expenditures


Food is great. It is a necessity of life and can also be a source of contentment, satisfaction, and even pleasure. As such, food comes in varying prices, depending on the quality, quantity, and convenience. It can be helpful for an individual or family to know how they spend their earnings on food.

This application allows users to track how much money they have spent on food. Food purchased will be entered by purchase and not by individual items bought. 

Input per entry will include purchase type, cost, and date of purchase. Output (results) will include total spending on food for each day, week, month, and year, as well as a breakdown of these spendings by purchase type. 

Users also have the option to input their hourly, monthly, or yearly wage and compare it to how much money they have been spending on different types of food.

Users must register to save their data server side or can opt to use the application as a guest, which will only store data locally using cookies. 

Entries will be tagged with only one of the following categories depending on purchase type:

-	Free Meal, *awesome!*
-	Groceries, *a little effort goes a long way!*
-	Fast food, *convenient!*
-	Restaurant, *delicious!*
-	Delivery, *delicious and convenient!*
-	Other, *Martians sent you a care package!*

The site will also include a bonus mini app on the side called the Cookie Crunchin’ Calculator:

This little app is designed to figure out how many cookies can fit in a specified three-dimensional container. Let’s say I want a bag full of cookies. How many cookies is that? User input will include the dimensions of the container (with many pre-calculated container types such as various sizes of plastic bags and plastic bins), and the size of the cookie. Output will be the number of cookies that can fit in the container with the specified dimensions. A drop-down box will be available with a list of different types of cookies since it is important to note whether the cookies are delicious or mundane. There will also be a checkbox for whether it is true or false that the cookies are, in fact, cooked, and not in the form of raw cookie dough. If the “cookies” I am trying to fit into a container is raw cookie dough, it will all be mashed together in the container and the number of cookies will always be ONE.
Output can also include how many trucks full of cookies can fit in the specified container. This separate measurement will include how many “trucks full”, “big trucks full”, and “really big trucks full” of cookies can fit in your container.
